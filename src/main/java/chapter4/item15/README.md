# Minimize mutability

To make a class immutable, follow these five rules:

1. Don’t provide any methods that modify the object’s state (known as mutators).


2. Ensure that the class can’t be extended. This prevents careless or malicious subclasses from compromising the immutable behavior of the class by behaving as if the object’s state has changed. Preventing subclassing is generally accomplished by making the class final, but there is an alternative that we’ll discuss later.


3. Make all fields final. This clearly expresses your intent in a manner that is enforced by the system. Also, it is necessary to ensure correct behavior if a reference to a newly created instance is passed from one thread to another without synchronization, as spelled out in the memory model [JLS, 17.5; Goetz06, 16].


4. Make all fields private. This prevents clients from obtaining access to mutable objects referred to by fields and modifying these objects directly. While it is technically permissible for immutable classes to have public final fields containing primitive values or references to immutable objects, it is not recommended because it precludes changing the internal representation in a later release (Item 13).


5. Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components. If your class has any fields that refer to mutable objects, ensure that clients of the class cannot obtain references to these objects. Never initialize such a field to a client-provided object reference or return the object reference from an accessor. Make defensive copies (Item 39) in constructors, accessors, and readObject methods (Item 76).

    private final double re;
    private final double im;

    public Complex(double re, double im) {
        this.re = re;
        this.im = im;
    }

    // Accessors with no corresponding mutators
    public double realPart()      { return re; }
    public double imaginaryPart() { return im; }

    public Complex add(Complex c) {
        return new Complex(re + c.re, im + c.im);
    }

    public Complex subtract(Complex c) {
        return new Complex(re - c.re, im - c.im);
    }

    public Complex multiply(Complex c) {
        return new Complex(re * c.re - im * c.im,
                           re * c.im + im * c.re);
    }

    public Complex divide(Complex c) {
        double tmp = c.re * c.re + c.im * c.im;
        return new Complex((re * c.re + im * c.im) / tmp,
                           (im * c.re - re * c.im) / tmp);
    }

       if (o == this)
           return true;
       if (!(o instanceof Complex))
           return false;
       Complex c = (Complex) o;

       return Double.compare(re, c.re) == 0 &&
              Double.compare(im, c.im) == 0;
    }


    @Override public int hashCode() {
        int result = 17 + hashDouble(re);
        result = 31 * result + hashDouble(im);
        return result;
    }

    private static int hashDouble(double val) {
        long longBits = Double.doubleToLongBits(val);
        return (int) (longBits ^ (longBits >>> 32));
    }

    @Override public String toString() {
        return "(" + re + " + " + im + "i)";
    }
