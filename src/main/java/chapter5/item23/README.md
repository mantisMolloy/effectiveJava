# Item 23: Don’t use raw types in new code

In summary, using raw types can lead to exceptions at runtime, so don’t use them in new code. They are provided only for compatibility and interoperability with legacy code that predates the introduction of generics. As a quick review, Set<Object> is a parameterized type representing a set that can contain objects of any type, Set<?> is a wildcard type representing a set that can contain only objects of some unknown type, and Set is a raw type, which opts out of the generic type system. The first two are safe and the last is not.
